# Stochastic Simulation Using R - Random Walks

## Introduction 

A Randon Walk is a elementary type of stochastic process that have many applications in a great variety of science fields.

This repository contains a poster made in LaTeX that explains and propose an algorithm for simulating such stochastic process.
